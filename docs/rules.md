# Competition rules

These rules exist to keep the competition fair and the leaderboard meaningful.

## The basics
- **Who can join:** anyone worldwide; solo or team
- **What you submit:** inference code as a `.zip`
- **How you’re scored:** a Public Leaderboard (feedback) and a Private Leaderboard (final ranking)
- **Submission limit:** up to 5 submissions per day

## Fair play
- **No external data:** train only on provided datasets
- **Pre-trained models allowed:** only if public and not trained on external market data
- **Offline execution:** your code runs in an isolated container with no internet access
- **No sharing full solutions:** avoid publishing code/weights/detailed strategies before the competition ends
- **No infra abuse:** attempts to exploit or leak scoring/data will be disqualified

## Final ranking and tie-breaking
- **Final rank:** determined solely by the Private Leaderboard score
- **Tie-break:** earlier submission time wins if scores are exactly equal
